# rgbduino
Small experiments made with RGBDuino Uno


### Requirements
In order to work with the RGBDuino, you need to install the driver, included here in the [driver](driver/) folder. For programming the RGB LEDs, you'll also need the Adafruit_NeoPixel library, also included here inside the [lib](lib/) folder for convenience.

**Note:** The included manual is outdated on the part about selecting the Arduino model in Arduino IDE. As the time of updating this readme, it worked by just selecting "Arduino Uno".
